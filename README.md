# Level3_cybersecurity_track
This is my repo to save writeups for the Level3 CS track

#### The Challenges can be found here: https://github.com/moabid42/Level-3  
#### This guided course is set up as follows:  
- At the start of each challenge period there is a  1hr lecture about the current topic, introducing it and sharing some keywords to help researching.  
- Then we have about 2 weeks time to solve the challenges and submit writeups for them.  
- At the end of the challenge period there is a solution lecture where we discuss the different solutions.

#### Topics so far:
- ##### Jails in bash, js and python
- ##### Format String Vulnerabilities
